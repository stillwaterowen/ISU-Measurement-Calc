Features:

Shape Selection: Users can select from a list of shapes, including 2D shapes (square, rectangle, triangle, circle) and 3D shapes (sphere, triangular prism, rectangular prism).

Direct Calculation: Once a shape is selected, users can input relevant dimensions (side length, width, height, radius, or area) and calculate the area or volume of the shape.

Reverse Calculation: Users can input the area or volume of a shape and automatically calculate missing dimensions, such as side length, radius, or height, depending on the shape selected.

Dynamic Form Fields: The input form adjusts based on the chosen shape, ensuring only relevant fields are displayed for the selected calculation.

Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with clean styling and interactive buttons.
